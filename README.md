# Random Forest Model Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Random Forest Classifier to predict income levels based on demographic and employment data.

### Problem Statement
The goal of the project is to classify whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year based on census data.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various attributes such as age, work class, education, occupation, etc., to predict income levels. (e.g., `income_evaluation.csv`)

### Steps Followed
1. Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features).
2. Model Training using Random Forest Classifier.
3. Hyperparameter Tuning to optimize performance.
4. Feature Importance Analysis.

### Key Results
- **Accuracy**: ~
- **Feature Importance Visualization**

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
